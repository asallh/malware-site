    "  - It remains inactive until certain actions (such as the execution of a program) cause the viral code to be executed.",
    "  - Like its namesake biological cousin, once a virus becomes active, it can spread to other computers that are connected on the same network.",
    "  - Viruses are capable of keylogging, stealing passwords, spamming contacts, and corrupting files on the computer.",
    "  - While some viruses are created as a joke and do no real harm, others can be designed to drastically and permanently alter computer systems such that they become unusable.",
    "<br>",

    "  - including corrupting/deleting files, overloading networks, stealing data, and opening backdoors for the installation of additional malware.",
    "  - Unlike viruses, however, worms are capable of spreading to other systems without any human intervention.",
    "  - They can spread through various means, including automated phishing attacks, replication across the network, file sharing, and infecting portable storage devices.",
    "  - Due to its nature as malware which does not require a host or human action to spread, it is considered much more dangerous than a virus.",

    "  - The purpose of adware is to generate revenue for its developers - they are paid whenever ads are shown, or when ads are clicked by the victim.",
    "  - While adware may merely seem annoying, they are also capable of tracking a victim’s search history, browsing patterns, and location data, and selling that information to third parties.",
